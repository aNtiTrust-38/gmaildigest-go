Start by reading `instructions.md` carefully â€” this is the full project roadmap.

We are beginning with **Milestone 7: Background Scheduling & Services**.

Your first step:
1. Generate the test cases as Go tests (as defined under "TDD Requirements" for M7).
2. Propose an outline for implementing Scheduler, WorkerPool, and TokenRefreshService.

Important: no production code without test cases first. Use concurrency-safe design. Suggest improvements where scope is unclear.

Confirm understanding before generating code.
